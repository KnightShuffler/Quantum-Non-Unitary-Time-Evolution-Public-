# Quantum Non-Unitary Time Evolution

Numerical and Qiskit implementations of the Quantum Non-Unitary Time Evolution (QNUTE) algorithm. This is an extension of the [Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0704-4) that allows us to simulate the dynamics of any linear PDE of the form
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} f(\vec{x},t) = \hat{H} f(\vec{x},t)$$
where the effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, can be an arbitrary, time-independent linear differential operator.
